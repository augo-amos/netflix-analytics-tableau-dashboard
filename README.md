# Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analytics Dashboard

*A Tableau Data Visualization Project*

This repository contains an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes the global distribution and evolution of Netflix’s content library. Using a dataset of more than 8,000 titles, the project explores where Netflix’s content comes from, how it is categorized, who it targets, and how the catalog has grown over time.

## Project Overview

Netflix has expanded rapidly across different markets, and this dashboard visualizes those changes through clear, data-driven storytelling. The analysis highlights:

* Regional content production patterns
* Distribution of movies vs. TV shows
* Dominant genres and audience ratings
* Growth trends across years
* How Netflix balances global and localized content

The goal is to provide a structured, visual narrative of Netflix’s catalog and how it reflects viewer demand and platform strategy.
